The principle is the following.

1 - The computer randomly draws a number between 1 and 10000
2 - There are 3 levels EASY, NORMAL and HARD - 1 to 10, 1 to 100 and 1 to 10000
3 - He asks you to guess the number. So you enter a number between 1 and 10000.
4 - The computer compares the number you entered with the “mystery” number it drew. 
It tells you if the mystery number is higher or lower than the one you entered.

5 - Then the computer asks you for the number again.
and it tells you whether the mystery number is higher or lower.
6 - And so on, until you find the mystery number. 
7 - The object of the game, of course, is to find the mystery number in as few moves as possible.
